Analyzing audio...
Transcribed: Hey, guys. How's it going? I just wanted to drop you a quick voice note and to ask you one simple question. Is this really my voice? What do you think?.

What's up guys? This is a voice cloned using 11 labs. Pretty cool, Huh? And it's no even their top tier way of cloning voices. That's right, because there is an even more realistic way of cloning voices via 11 labs that is so advanced. Only one voice per account is the max, no matter what subscription you have. You also have to go through a verification process before you can even use that voice. We live in the future.
