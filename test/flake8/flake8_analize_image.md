## 1st.Run

```bash
❯ flake8 analyze_image.py
analyze_image.py:96:80: E501 line too long (87 > 79 characters)
analyze_image.py:98:80: E501 line too long (84 > 79 characters)

Fixed the issues and now the code is clean and ready to be used.

These issues are not critical, but it is always good to have a clean code.
