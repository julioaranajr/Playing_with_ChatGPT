## Solution

The module `analyze_image.py` has been rated at 9.17/10 by Pylint. The following issues were identified and fixed:

- **Wildcard import**: The wildcard import of `stringcolor` was removed.
- **Too many local variables**: The number of local variables was reduced to 15.
- **Catching too general exception**: The exception handling was made more specific.
- **Missing timeout argument**: A timeout argument was added to the `requests.post` method.
- **Inconsistent return statements**: All return statements now return an expression.
- **Unused imports**: The unused imports were removed.

After addressing these issues, the code quality improved from 8.75/10 to 9.17/10.
